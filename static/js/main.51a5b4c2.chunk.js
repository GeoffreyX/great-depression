Roosevelt, who then implemented several waves of \u201cNew Deals\u201d.

In 1927, the New York Federal Reserve sold tens of thousands of treasury bonds, and convinced the other members of the Fed to raise discount rates from 3.5% to 6.0%, which resulted in a large decrease in the money supply.

As a result, according to the National Bureau for Economic Research, contractionary monetary policy remained in place for the first half of the 1930s, leading to a decrease in the money supply, a rise in interest rates, and a continued fall in aggregate demand.
