Additionally, the money quantity demanded fell rapidly, and the money multiplier effect was drastically reduced as consumers began to buy as little goods and services as possible.

Though the US would not shift away from the Gold Standard fully until 1971, the Great Depression did a great deal to lower the faith of many US consumers in the Gold Standard.`,\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            linkType: 0,\r\n            link: 'https://depts.washington.edu/depress/images/hoovervilles/Hooverville%20Front%20Page.jpg',\r\n            linkBrief: 'The Great Depression got so dire that small settlements of homeless veterans began forming in abandoned areas.

However, as the economy crashed suddenly in 1929, the government responded quickly, but not correctly. Similar to the approach towards monetary policy, fiscal policy remained contractionary. These contractionary policies forced the aggregate demand leftwards, far too fast for supply to readjust. A series of actions led by President Hoover during his 1929 - 1933 presidency stalled economic growth and delayed economic recovery. This was followed by Franklin D. Roosevelt, who then implemented several waves of “New Deals”. And while government policies were partially effective from 1933 onwards, another wave of recession hit the economy in the late 1930s, only eventually recovering with the onset of WWII.`,\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            linkType: 1,\r\n            link: 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/C4CvLu8HA7I',\r\n            text: `\\tUnlike the theories of Hoover not acting in the early signs of the Great Depression, the 31st president actually heavily used the government’s influence to try and correct for the onsetting depression. However, solutions implemented were founded upon fundamentally flawed classical economic theories, resulting in the opposite effect that Hoover desired. According to Britannica, one of the first steps in the development of the depression was fixing high wages during the depression, and urging businesses to not lay off workers. Despite the pressure, the fixed wages and the growing depression meant that  businesses weren’t able to keep afloat with their expenses, eventually causing unemployment to skyrocket.

Many economists believe that this crash was at least partially caused by the actions of the Federal Reserve in attempting to address a smaller crash which occurred from 1927-1928. In 1927, the New York Federal Reserve sold tens of thousands of treasury bonds, and convinced the other members of the Fed to raise discount rates from 3.5% to 6.0%, which resulted in a large decrease in the money supply. These changes resulted in a temporary reversal of the crash, but also set the stage for a larger economic fall once the Great Depression began.`,\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            linkType: 3,\r\n            links: [\r\n                {\r\n                    link:'https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52cdc300e4b012a81d31c03d/1415625255109-6LBCPQ3JC9KZZO85ZCM3/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kAuY86Hw9PfoJOj9N7gszFgUqsxRUqqbr1mOJYKfIPR7LoDQ9mXPOjoJoqy81S2I8N_N4V1vUb5AoIIIbLZhVYxCRW4BPu10St3TBAUQYVKcPIL9geLof-EToOAAn-kVWC1XPIQf7uVPzCc6OE-KWLR-uoS0vfYvf2qy9Qq6CBAJ/image-asset.png?format=750w',\r\n                    linkBrief: 'US Monetary Policy Through The Early 1930s',\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    link: 'https://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/depmon0.gif',\r\n                    linkBrief: 'US Monetary Policy Through The Early 1930s',\r\n                },\r\n            ],\r\n            \r\n            text: `\\tAs the graphs show, The Fed was extremely slow to reverse its contractionary monetary policy in the Great Depression, with the New York Branch being one of the few members to actively attempt to change monetary policy, buying treasury bonds and attempting to convince their fellow members to raise the reserve ratio rate and lower the discount rate. As a result, according to the National Bureau for Economic Research, contractionary monetary policy remained in place for the first half of the 1930s, leading to a decrease in the money supply, a rise in interest rates, and a continued fall in aggregate demand.

In future economic crises, the Fed would be more careful with applying monetary policy, to avoid strengthening future economic crises, with the results clearly being shown in these graphs in the form of thousands of less banks closing in the economic crises after The Great Depression. The Great Recession was a terrible economic recession, but The Federal Reserve was cautious and innovative in addressing the crisis, leading to far less bank closures and economic turmoil than the Great Recession. While the Great Depression was a clear failure for the Federal Reserves in many ways, especially in monetary policy, the Fed learned and improved from its mistakes, which is the ultimate legacy of the Fed’s role in the Great Depression.`,\r\n        }\r\n    ];\r\n\r\n    const dates = [\r\n        (<Date year='Overview' />),\r\n        (<Date year='1929' />),\r\n        (<Date year='Early 1930s' />),\r\n        (<Date year='Late 1930s - 1940s' />),\r\n        (<Date year='Future' />),\r\n    ]\r\n\r\n    return (\r\n        <div className='Monetary'>\r\n           <Slideshow slides={slides} dates={dates} />\r\n        </div>\r\n    );\r\n};","import React from 'react';\r\nimport FadeIn from 'react-fade-in';\r\n\r\nimport './Links.css';\r\n\r\nexport default function Links(props) {\r\n\r\n    const citations = [\r\n        {\r\n            start: `Amadeo, Kimberly. `,\r\n            end: `“How FDR Beat the Great Depression.” The Balance, 11 Nov. 2020, thebalance.com/fdr-economic-policies-and-accomplishments-3305557.`,\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            start: `Amadeo, Kimberly. `,\r\n            end: `“What Happened During the Great Depression?” The Balance, The Balanace, 27 May 2020, www.thebalance.com/the-great-depression-of-1929-3306033.`,\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            start: `Cogley, Timothy. `,\r\n            end: `“Monetary Policy and the Great Crash of 1929: A Bursting Bubble or Collapsing Fundamentals?” Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, 26 Mar. 1999, www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/1999/march/monetary-policy-and-the-great-crash-of-1929-a-bursting-bubble-or-collapsing-fundamentals/#:~:text=In%20any%20event%2C%20monetary%20policy,economic%20activity%20and%20share%20prices.`,\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            start: `“Dow Jones - DJIA`,\r\n            end: ` - 100 Year Historical Chart.” MacroTrends, MacroTrends, 27 Apr. 2021, www.macrotrends.net/1319/dow-jones-100-year-historical-chart. `,\r\n        },\r\n                {\r\n            start: `“Fed Strategies`,\r\n            end: `in the Great Depression and the Great Recession.” NBER, NBER, 11 Nov. 2016, www.nber.org/digest/nov16/fed-strategies-great-depression-and-great-recession#:~:text=That%20was%20U.S.%20monetary%20policy,brought%20down%20interest%20rates%20dramatically.&text=The%20U.S.%20was%20on%20the,2008%20exchange%20rates%20floated%20freely.`,\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            start: `“Herbert Hoover.” `,\r\n            end: `Encyclopædia Britannica, Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc., 14 July 2018, www.britannica.com/biography/Herbert-Hoover.`,\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            start: `History.com Staff. `,\r\n            end: `“Great Depression History.” HISTORY, A&E Television Networks, 30 Apr. 2021, history.com/topics/great-depression/great-depression-history.`,\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            start: `Hoover, A.
