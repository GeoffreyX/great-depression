These contractionary policies forced the aggregate demand leftwards, far too fast for supply to readjust.. A series of actions led by President Hoover during his 1929 - 1933 presidency stalled economic growth and hurt the economy. This was followed by Franklin D. Roosevelt, who then implemented several waves of \u201cNew Deals\u201d.

However, solutions implemented were founded upon fundamentally flawed classical economic theories, resulting in the opposite effect that Hoover desired. One of the first steps in the development of the depression was fixing high wages during the depression, and urging businesses to not lay off workers. Despite the pressure, the fixed wages and the growing depression meant that  businesses weren\u2019t able to keep afloat with their expenses, eventually causing unemployment to skyrocket (Britannica). Controversially, the president also signed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act and kept high taxes throughout his presidential term.

Many economists believe that this crash was at least partially caused by the actions of the Federal Reserve in attempting to address a smaller crash which occurred from 1927-1928. In 1927, the New York Federal Reserve sold tens of thousands of treasury bonds, and convinced the other members of the Fed to raise discount rates from 3.5% to 6.0%, which resulted in a large decrease in the money supply. These changes resulted in a temporary reversal of the crash, but also set the stage for a larger economic fall once the Great Depression began."},{linkType:3,links:["https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52cdc300e4b012a81d31c03d/1415625255109-6LBCPQ3JC9KZZO85ZCM3/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kAuY86Hw9PfoJOj9N7gszFgUqsxRUqqbr1mOJYKfIPR7LoDQ9mXPOjoJoqy81S2I8N_N4V1vUb5AoIIIbLZhVYxCRW4BPu10St3TBAUQYVKcPIL9geLof-EToOAAn-kVWC1XPIQf7uVPzCc6OE-KWLR-uoS0vfYvf2qy9Qq6CBAJ/image-asset.png?format=750w","https://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/depmon0.gif"],linkBrief:"US Monetary Policy Through The Early 1930s",text:"\tAs the graphs show, The Fed was extremely slow to reverse its contractionary monetary policy in the Great Depression, with the New York Branch being one of the few members to actively attempt to change monetary policy, buying treasury bonds and attempting to convince their fellow members to raise the reserve ratio rate and lower the discount rate. As a result, according to the National Bureau for Economic Research, contractionary monetary policy remained in place for the first half of the 1930s, leading to a decrease in the money supply, a rise in interest rates, and a continued fall in aggregate demand. Additionally, the refusal of most Branches of the Fed to buy treasury bonds or to raise the reserve ratio rate further decreased aggregate demand by keeping the money supply consistently low."},{linkType:1,link:"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OPzE7tz--Aiu8vSRNHDyfbu78zt0aRf_/preview",text:"\tAccording to the National Bureau for Economic Research, the Fed began to shift out of their contractionary monetary policy stance in the late 1930s by buying large amounts of US Treasury bonds, in addition to raising the reserve ratio rate by 5%. This change led to a decrease in the interest rate and an increase in the money supply, which encouraged the Fed to continue to shift towards expansionary monetary policy. When the War began for the US in late 1941, the Great Depression was finally ended thanks to a large increase in Government Spending, which, along with the expansionary monetary policy, drove aggregate demand to soaring heights and vastly increased the GDP.

The Great Recession was a terrible economic recession, but The Federal Reserve was cautious and innovative in addressing the crisis, leading to far less bank closures and economic turmoil than the Great Recession.
