Additionally, the money quantity demanded fell rapidly, and the money multiplier effect was drastically reduced as consumers began to buy as little goods and services as possible.

Though the US would not shift away from the Gold Standard fully until 1971, the Great Depression did a great deal to lower the faith of many US consumers in the Gold Standard.`,\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            linkType: 0,\r\n            link: 'https://depts.washington.edu/depress/images/hoovervilles/Hooverville%20Front%20Page.jpg',\r\n            linkBrief: 'The Great Depression got so dire that small settlements of homeless veterans began forming in abandoned areas.

However, as the economy crashed suddenly in 1929, the government responded quickly, but not correctly. Similar to the approach towards monetary policy, fiscal policy remained contractionary. These contractionary policies forced the aggregate demand leftwards, far too fast for supply to readjust.. A series of actions led by President Hoover during his 1929 - 1933 presidency stalled economic growth and hurt the economy. This was followed by Franklin D. Roosevelt, who then implemented several waves of “New Deals”. And while government policies were partially effective from 1933 onwards, another wave of recession hit the economy in the late 1930s, only eventually recovering with the onset of WWII.`,\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            linkType: 1,\r\n            link: 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/C4CvLu8HA7I',\r\n            text: `\\tUnlike the theories of Hoover not acting in the early signs of the Great Depression, the 31st president actually heavily used the government’s influence to try and correct for the onsetting depression. However, solutions implemented were founded upon fundamentally flawed classical economic theories, resulting in the opposite effect that Hoover desired. One of the first steps in the development of the depression was fixing high wages during the depression, and urging businesses to not lay off workers. Despite the pressure, the fixed wages and the growing depression meant that  businesses weren’t able to keep afloat with their expenses, eventually causing unemployment to skyrocket (Britannica). Controversially, the president also signed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act and kept high taxes throughout his presidential term. `,\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            linkType: 0,\r\n            link: 'https://depts.washington.edu/depress/images/hoovervilles/Hooverville%20Front%20Page.jpg',\r\n            linkBrief: 'The Great Depression got so dire that small settlements of homeless veterans began forming in abandoned areas.

Many economists believe that this crash was at least partially caused by the actions of the Federal Reserve in attempting to address a smaller crash which occurred from 1927-1928. In 1927, the New York Federal Reserve sold tens of thousands of treasury bonds, and convinced the other members of the Fed to raise discount rates from 3.5% to 6.0%, which resulted in a large decrease in the money supply. These changes resulted in a temporary reversal of the crash, but also set the stage for a larger economic fall once the Great Depression began.`,\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            linkType: 3,\r\n            links: [\r\n                'https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/52cdc300e4b012a81d31c03d/1415625255109-6LBCPQ3JC9KZZO85ZCM3/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kAuY86Hw9PfoJOj9N7gszFgUqsxRUqqbr1mOJYKfIPR7LoDQ9mXPOjoJoqy81S2I8N_N4V1vUb5AoIIIbLZhVYxCRW4BPu10St3TBAUQYVKcPIL9geLof-EToOAAn-kVWC1XPIQf7uVPzCc6OE-KWLR-uoS0vfYvf2qy9Qq6CBAJ/image-asset.png?format=750w',\r\n                'https://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/depmon0.gif',\r\n            ],\r\n            linkBrief: 'US Monetary Policy Through The Early 1930s',\r\n            text: `\\tAs the graphs show, The Fed was extremely slow to reverse its contractionary monetary policy in the Great Depression, with the New York Branch being one of the few members to actively attempt to change monetary policy, buying treasury bonds and attempting to convince their fellow members to raise the reserve ratio rate and lower the discount rate. As a result, according to the National Bureau for Economic Research, contractionary monetary policy remained in place for the first half of the 1930s, leading to a decrease in the money supply, a rise in interest rates, and a continued fall in aggregate demand. Additionally, the refusal of most Branches of the Fed to buy treasury bonds or to raise the reserve ratio rate further decreased aggregate demand by keeping the money supply consistently low.`,\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            linkType: 1,\r\n            link: 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OPzE7tz--Aiu8vSRNHDyfbu78zt0aRf_/preview',\r\n            text: `\\tAccording to the National Bureau for Economic Research, the Fed began to shift out of their contractionary monetary policy stance in the late 1930s by buying large amounts of US Treasury bonds, in addition to raising the reserve ratio rate by 5%. This change led to a decrease in the interest rate and an increase in the money supply, which encouraged the Fed to continue to shift towards expansionary monetary policy. When the War began for the US in late 1941, the Great Depression was finally ended thanks to a large increase in Government Spending, which, along with the expansionary monetary policy, drove aggregate demand to soaring heights and vastly increased the GDP. `,\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            linkType: 3,\r\n            links: [\r\n                'http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_otfwl2zc6Qc/SpcfEsicudI/AAAAAAAALJ4/NIVVlgOz4OQ/s400/bank4.jpg',\r\n                picture,\r\n            ],\r\n            text: `\\tAccording to Daniel Sanches of Federal Reserve History, The Great Depression substantially changed the use of Monetary Policy for the Federal Reserve. The Fed’s refusal to shift away from contractionary monetary policy had been a flawed decision which had strengthened the economic crash and done little to accomplish its initial goal of keeping stock prices up. In future economic crises, the Fed would be more careful with applying monetary policy, to avoid strengthening future economic crises, with the results clearly being shown in these graphs in the form of thousands of less banks closing in the economic crises after The Great Depression. The Great Recession was a terrible economic recession, but The Federal Reserve was cautious and innovative in addressing the crisis, leading to far less bank closures and economic turmoil than the Great Recession. While the Great Depression was a clear failure for the Federal Reserves in many ways, especially in monetary policy, the Fed learned and improved from its mistakes, which is the ultimate legacy of the Fed’s role in the Great Depression.`,\r\n        }\r\n    ];\r\n\r\n    const dates = [\r\n        (<Date year='Overview' />),\r\n        (<Date year='1929' />),\r\n        (<Date year='Early 1930s'
