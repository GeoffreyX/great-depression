However, as the economy crashed suddenly in 1929, the government responded quickly, but not correctly. Similar to the approach towards monetary policy, fiscal policy remained contractionary. These contractionary policies forced the aggregate demand leftwards, far too fast for supply to readjust.. A series of actions led by President Hoover during his 1929 - 1933 presidency stalled economic growth and hurt the economy. This was followed by Franklin D. Roosevelt, who then implemented several waves of \u201cNew Deals\u201d. And while government policies were partially effective from 1933 onwards, another wave of recession hit the economy in the late 1930s, only eventually recovering with the onset of WWII."},{linkType:1,link:"https://www.youtube.com/embed/C4CvLu8HA7I",text:"\tUnlike the theories of Hoover not acting in the early signs of the Great Depression, the 31st president actually heavily used the government\u2019s influence to try and correct for the onsetting depression. However, solutions implemented were founded upon fundamentally flawed classical economic theories, resulting in the opposite effect that Hoover desired. One of the first steps in the development of the depression was fixing high wages during the depression, and urging businesses to not lay off workers. Despite the pressure, the fixed wages and the growing depression meant that  businesses weren\u2019t able to keep afloat with their expenses, eventually causing unemployment to skyrocket (Britannica). Controversially, the president also signed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act and kept high taxes throughout his presidential term.

These camps were coined 'Hoovervilles'.",text:"\tHoover, seeing that initial fiscal policy had not worked, drafted systems very similar to those that would be found in the New Deal - hints of a Works Public Administration, loans, and other financing plans. However, throughout all of his presidency, he refused to directly grant money to the public, fearing what he believed to be socialism (The Gilder Lehrman). In the end, Hoover implemented too many contractionary policies and didn\u2019t take enough expansionary steps for the economy, and very likely increased the Great Depression\u2019s duration."},{linkType:1,link:"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0rjtOWn5mj0",text:"\tUnlike Hoover, Roosevelt did not shy away from directly granting money.Unemployment had almost risen to 25% (FRED), and some of these policies stopped the steep progression of the Depression.

Two examples are the WPA and RFC. The Works Public Administration (WPA) spent money to contract workers and companies to construct public projects. The Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) lended tax dollars to banks, firms and other institutions. While these efforts were initially controversial, they proved to work well, decreasing unemployment year by year."},{linkType:0,link:"https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2020/04/09/AP4502230131_c0-860-5000-3775_s885x516.jpg?5acecb7673096efdc929597b8dd2705e002fc652 ",text:"\tFDR implemented most of these policies in the first 100 days of his presidency. However, a second \u201cNew Deal\u201d implemented in 1935 focused more on regulations and the restructuring of the law. These policies ultimately had mixed results, and did not have great success. Just after the 2nd New Deal, the recession of 1937 sent the economy back into a downturn, with unemployment rising again (The Balance).
